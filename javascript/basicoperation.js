// what is hoisting
// In javascript, you can call a function before it is defined and you won’t get an error ‘Uncaught ReferenceError’. The reason behind this is hoisting where the javascript interpreter always moves the variables and function declaration to the top of the current scope (function scope or global scope) before the code execution. Let’s understand this with example.
// inshort function and variable are initialised at start of execution
// thats why we dont get Uncaught ReferenceError

// What is async and await

// what are promises

// What is the difference between == and ===
var x = 2;
var y = '2';
(x == y)(
  // Returns true since the value of both x and y is the same

  x === y,
); // Returns false since the typeof x is "number" and typeof y is "string"

// Will it be executed or will it generate error
var x = 3;
var y = '3';
x + y; // Returns "33"

// objects question

// I want name
var obj = { name: 'Vivek', surname: 'Bisht' };
var obj2 = obj;

// how to use and what is map  function
//  Difference between map and forEach function

// Arrow function is react js

// useSate and useEffect hooks in js
